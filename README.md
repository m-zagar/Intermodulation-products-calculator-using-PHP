# Intermoduation products calculator using PHP
Web application created for the "Selective Project I" course. Chosen subject was "Computing skills". (Undergraduate University Study of Computing)

The goal of the project was to create a web application that would, given a set of user input parameters/variables, calculate and plot intermodulation products. 

The idea was explain to the user what intermodulation products are and how to calculate them, to give the user a simple UI for inputing variables and to simply visualize said products from the given variables. 

The code was written using vanilla HTML, PHP, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the Highcharts JavaScript library for plotting the graph.
